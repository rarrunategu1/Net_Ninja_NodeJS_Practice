WHAT IS NODE.JS
a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Javascript engine.
(Allows us to run javascripton a computer/serveer)
It's event driven and non-blocking. -very fast since it's nonblocking and since it uses V8 engine   
(Read, delete and update files; easily communicate with a database)
Its package ecosystem, npm, is the largesst ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
Great for real time services - Chatrooms

Inner workings
-v8 engine, modules, event emiiter, fs

Creating a web server
-routing, express, templating

HOW TO INSTALL NODE JS
Go to nodejs.org and download one
Note that when downloading pick the one that says LTS (Long Term Support) - because it's the most stable

in the command line write node -v to find out what version you have

*if you're in the folder where your app is, then you can run it on the command line by just using node app.  You don't need to do node app.js

V8 ENGINE
What is a javascript engine?
    -computers don't understand javascript and so the engine converts it into machine code so that it is understood.
    -this machine code is not good for programming because it's messy and hard to understand.  It's how computers talk.
    
    Node JS is written in C++ because it uses the v8 engine (embedded in it) which is also written in C++ but it allows us to write javascript which can run on a computer or server
    
THE GLOBAL OBJECT
When writing javascript in browser, the global object is the window object and we can access properties and methods like alert, settimeout etc.
When writing it in node, it's no longer a window object.  It's a global object that still gives us access to some methods we can use in node js
    
    
on node we can

console.log

setTimeout -
setTimeout(function(){
    console.log('3 seconds have passed');
}, 3000);

setInterval -
var time = 0;
setInterval(function() {
    time +=2;
 console.log(time + '3 seconds have passed');
}, 2000); //this will give you something like this when you run it:
23 seconds have passed
43 seconds have passed
63 seconds have passed
83 seconds have passed
103 seconds have passed
123 seconds have passed
143 seconds have passed
163 seconds have passed
183 seconds have passed
203 seconds have passed
223 seconds have passed
ctrl C will stop it in the terminal

An example of using a timer is:
var time = 0;

var timer = setInterval(function() {
    time +=2;
 console.log(time + '3 seconds have passed');
 if (time > 5){  //after 5 seconds it'll stop running the function
     clearInterval(timer);
 }
}, 2000); 

Enter the following on the app.js file:

console.log(__dirname); //when you run the code it will return the directory youre in

console.log(__filename);  //this will return the file name youre working on.

Look up in google -> node.js 'the version you have' documentation  - to find more information on global objects in node
